Installation
------------

The installation is trivial and follows the usual formula for installation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install  

There should be no limitations on platform or operating system,
however a somewhat recent version of perl is needed. The module asks
for Perl 5.8.0 or newer, but it would probably work with an older
version if you have the Switch module available.

Please report any problems to leijon@ludd.ltu.se.
